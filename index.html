   <p>
    <b>Happy birthday my girl. </b>
    My day starts with your <big>Good Morning</big> and ends with your<big> Good Night </big>. I am very lucky to have you in my life. In you, I have found the love of my life, my closest and truest friend. I am very thankful to you for the support, love and care you show towards me. The way you care for me reminds me of my Mother. <br>
    <i>You are my sun, moon, and all my stars.</i><br>
    Cheers to you on your special day!

            <p>This photo takes me back to the day we first went out together and it is the first photo we every clicked together. It makes me relive the moment and is one the best memories. The beginning of our journey,captured in a single frame representing both our lives will be one from now on gives me goosebumps everytime I think of it.</p>

            <p>Manglore, the first trip we ever took together. Those three days of togetherness felt like unlocking a new level of closeness among us. Resting on your shoulders when you rode the scooty, climbing Konajekallu together made me feel like we can face any obstacle without any fear and the only thing we needed was each other. Vintage jokes of Sandeep made our trip a little better. <i><b>Our Pre-wedding Photoshoot,</b></i> Ofcourse. Remember when we sat in NITK ground? It is the first time we spoke that late in the night alone. It obviously is a moment to cherish.</p>

    <p>Thank you for being so important in my life and bringing me the happiness that I never deserved. I am fool for not being able to appreciate the happiness in my life in your form. You make me so happy that I am unable to describe it.</p>
